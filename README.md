Watch UI Mockup Video provided as a reference below. In the video, we describe some important components of the mobile UI of the Telegram messaging app.
Your task is to create a pixel-perfect replica of the telegram messaging application - both in desktop view and mobile view using ReactJS.
It is highly recommended to explore the Telegram app yourself and not just rely on the mockup video.
Try to replicate as much of the Telegram UI / UX as possible.
We have also provided two API endpoints below which you need to use to display the chats and their messages.
Finally, please deploy the project publicly so we can view and evaluate your submission.

API endpoint 1: 
Description: Returns list of chats (paginated API)
URL: https://devapi.beyondchats.com/api/get_all_chats?page=1
Type: Get Request

API endpoint 2: 
Description: Returns list of messages given a chat_id
URL: https://devapi.beyondchats.com/api/get_chat_messages?chat_id=3888
Type: Get Request
